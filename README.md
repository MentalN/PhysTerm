# PhysTerm

PhysTerm is a terminal program written in Python 3.6 that performs a variaty of calculations of in different fields of physics.


# Running The Program
PhysTerm is ran from terminal using python. In Windows command prompt, this done using the following command:
      
      > python PhysTerm.py

and in Linux:

      > python3 PhysTerm.py

Running the program with full functionality requires the following dependecies:

      - SymPy

During runtime, the program itself have built-in commands to guide the user through the program:
      
      - The user can type "list" anytime during the program runtime to display the available commands the user can type in to perform a specific calculation or to select a field.
      
      - The user can type "exit" to terminate the program.

When the user inputting values for some physics calculations, they can just type in the "name" of a value, for instance:
      
      - When calculating gravitational force, the user can type "venus" when inputting mass to get the mass of planet Venus.
      
      - When calculating drag force, the user can type "sphere" when inputting drag coeffecient to get to get the value for sphere
